# Crll bAsset Hub  <!-- omit in toc -->

**NOTE**: Reference documentation for this contract is available [here](https://crll-protocol.gitbook.io/crll/bluna/hub).

The Hub contract acts as the central hub for all minted bLuna. Native Luna tokens received from users are delegated from here, and undelegations from bLuna unbond requests are also handled from this contract. Rewards generated from delegations are withdrawn to the Reward contract, later distributed to bLuna holders.
